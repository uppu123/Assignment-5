# Assignment-5

This repository contains two Python tasks for Assignment 5.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks (Task1.py)

### Description

This script demonstrates the use of a Python dictionary to store and retrieve data. It initializes a dictionary called `students` where each key is a student's name (a string) and each value is their corresponding mark (an integer).

The script then:
1.  Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
2.  Checks if the entered name exists as a key in the `students` dictionary.
3.  If the name is found, it prints the student's name and their marks.
4.  If the name is not found, it prints a "Student not found." message.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing (Task2.py)

### Description

This script demonstrates basic list manipulation techniques in Python, specifically slicing and reversing.

The script:
1.  Initializes a list named `list` containing integers from 1 to 10.
2.  Uses list slicing (`list[0:5]`) to extract the first five elements and stores them in a new list called `list1`.
3.  Prints the original `list`.
4.  Prints the new `list1` containing the extracted elements.
5.  Reverses the elements of `list1` in-place using the `.reverse()` method.
6.  Prints the modified `list1` to show its reversed order.
